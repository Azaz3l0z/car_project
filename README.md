# CarScrapper
The CarScrapper project aims to create a Java GUI to download ads from some
websites like [coches](https://www.coches.net/), 
[milanuncios](https://www.milanuncios.com/) and 
[autoscout24](https://www.autoscout24.es/) to a '.csv' file.

## The GUI
The GUI of the program is made with Java and NETBeans. It consists of various
dropdowns, a download and a config button. With the dropdows you can specify
what you want to download specifically and from which website. With the config
button you can choose where the file will be downloaded.
